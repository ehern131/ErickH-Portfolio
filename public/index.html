    <h3 id="aboutme">About Me</h3>
    <p>They'll just fall right out of my ass! I've done this too many times! I don't think we can perform our new song, The Recipe For Concentrated Dark Matter for a crowd this tiny! I don't get it and I don't need to. Yea and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mothers ovaries!</p>
    <p>Allahu blehhhh Akbar! Like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You know what those guys do in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other. You know Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't shady. Well he roped me into this! If anything happened to you I would kill myself! I love you bad, bobo!</p>
    <p>Nice, Mrs Pancakes. Real nice. Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man. Dont mind those stare goblins.</p>
    <p>Aw, geez. Lemme hear everybody say hey-yo! All the ladies say yeaaah! Everybody over thirty do this with your hand! Everybody with a red shirt jump up and down! Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an L who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times teeenn! You're young, you have your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut yet malleable. If it were, you could call ME Ernest Hemingway.</p>

      <p>Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of them, Rick! Oh, I'm sorry Morty, are you the scientist or are you the kid who wanted to get laid? Where are my testicles, Summer? Not for the men they cheat on.</p>
